<!--In js almost everything is an object 

- Data types like boolen, string, dates are objects. Even funtions are objects.

- Items, things , animals, and people are objects that have  property, behaviors, 
attributes and methods(actions)

A person can have a attributes like name, age, phone #, job title, etc --> 
<script>
var person  = {
firstName : 'Lisa',
lastName : ' James',
phone: '333-555-8884',
age: '100',
sound : "Speak"
}
//if an object is an item like a car ,it'll have make, model ,year  action, etc :
var car = {
make: 'Toyota',
model: 'Corolla',
year : '2020',
color: 'Green',
action : "Drive"
}
// To access and display a propery/attribute  of an object , we could use a dot noation between the obj's name and it's property/attribute

//create function to display the person info using 'this'  keyword which refers to the obj itself 
person.info = function(){
return "Person Information: " + this.firstName + " , " + this.lastName  + " ," + this.phone + 
" , " + this.age + " " + this.sound;
};

//Create function to display the car info using 'this' keyword which refers to the obj itself 
car.info = function(){
return  "Car Information:"  + this.make + ", " + this.model  + " ," + this.year + " ," + 
    this.color + " ," + this.action;
};
// get  p tag  from DOM/HTML to display the car info on the screen 
document.getElementById('car').innerHTML = car.info();
// get  p tag  from DOM/HTMLto display the car info on the screen 
document.getElementById('person').innerHTML = person.info();
